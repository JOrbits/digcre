In early experiments I tried to generate videos from prompts using different settings.

### Cabin Zoom
In this video I tried to create the “zoom dream” effect, while iterating through different seasons.
After a set amount of frames the prompt changes to a different season. So the cabin starts in summer and goes through a full year.

### Money Zoom
The same I tried with animating through different prompts to show some sort of theme.
The different themes include:
- Dollar notes
- Coins
- Gold
- Stock Market
- Suits
- Yachts
- Bitcoin
- Watches

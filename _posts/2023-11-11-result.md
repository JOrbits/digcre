# The monolith

I wanted to create a video of a monolith flying to earth and changing it in a postive way.
Earth is shown as a wasteland in the beginning of the video, then the monolith makes a dramatic entrance.
Upon landing the planet turns green and alive again.

## Technology
- Stable Diffusion
- Automatic1111
- Model: Cheese Daddy's Landscapes mix
- Deforum
- ControlNet
- Blender
- Premier Pro

## How it looks

I uploaded the final result to YouTube, although it looses a lot of quality due to the compression. On the presentation day the uncompressed video was shown.

## Music

The music is the theme of the movie Space Odyssey, which also features a monolith.
It is part of a symphony from Strauss called "Also sprach Zarathustra"

## Storyboard

The storyboard was drawn in Photoshop using a wacom tablet. I was not able to follow it fully though, because it was very difficult to generate animal skeletons using Stable Diffusion. It kept generating
human skulls or skeletons which looks like straight out of a horror movie.

## Inspiration

I tried to find some images to use as inspiration for the video.

## Blender

To get Stable Diffusion to create what I wanted it to do I had to create input videos with Blender.
All input videos were rendered normally and as depth map for ControlNet. This method made some
sequences a lot more stable.

## Deforum

The clips were made using the Deforum extension. The first the clips use different forms of transformation, for example zoom or movement in the x or y axis. The middle clips are really dependant on ControlNet and video input, which was made with Blender. The final clips all use Prompts with timestamps in order to create the effect of the planet becoming green.

## PremierPro

All clips were put together in PremierPro. Also all transitions used are "fade to black".
